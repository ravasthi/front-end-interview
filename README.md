# Front-end interview question #

This project contains the boilerplate for a front-end engineer interview question, with several variations and stages so that it can be adapted to interviewees of various skill levels.

It is based off the [55 Minutes CSS3 Foundation project](https://github.com/ravasthi/css3-foundation).

More details to come soon.
